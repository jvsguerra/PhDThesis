  abstract = {Tunnels and channels facilitate the transport of small molecules, ions and water solvent in a large variety of proteins. Characteristics of individual transport pathways, including their geometry, physico-chemical properties and dynamics are instrumental for understanding of structure-function relationships of these proteins, for the design of new inhibitors and construction of improved biocatalysts. CAVER is a software tool widely used for the identification and characterization of transport pathways in static macromolecular structures. Herein we present a new version of CAVER enabling automatic analysis of tunnels and channels in large ensembles of protein conformations. CAVER 3.0 implements new algorithms for the calculation and clustering of pathways. A trajectory from a molecular dynamics simulation serves as the typical input, while detailed characteristics and summary statistics of the time evolution of individual pathways are provided in the outputs. To illustrate the capabilities of CAVER 3.0, the tool was applied for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulation of the microbial enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA. CAVER 3.0 safely identified and reliably estimated the importance of all previously published DhaA tunnels, including the tunnels closed in DhaA crystal structures. Obtained results clearly demonstrate that analysis of molecular dynamics simulation is essential for the estimation of pathway characteristics and elucidation of the structural basis of the tunnel gating. CAVER 3.0 paves the way for the study of important biochemical phenomena in the area of molecular transport, molecular recognition and enzymatic catalysis. The software is freely available as a multiplatform command-line application at http://www.caver.cz.},

  abstract = { ADP-ribosylation is a common posttranslational modification that may have antiviral properties and impact innate immunity. To regulate this activity, macrodomain proteins enzymatically remove covalently attached ADP-ribose from protein targets. All members of the Coronavirinae, a subfamily of positive-sense RNA viruses, contain a highly conserved macrodomain within nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). However, its function or targets during infection remain unknown. We identified several macrodomain mutations that greatly reduced nsp3's de-ADP-ribosylation activity in vitro. Next, we created recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains with these mutations. These mutations led to virus attenuation and a modest reduction of viral loads in infected mice, despite normal replication in cell culture. Further, macrodomain mutant virus elicited an early, enhanced interferon (IFN), interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), and proinflammatory cytokine response in mice and in a human bronchial epithelial cell line. Using a coinfection assay, we found that inclusion of mutant virus in the inoculum protected mice from an otherwise lethal SARS-CoV infection without reducing virus loads, indicating that the changes in innate immune response were physiologically significant. In conclusion, we have established a novel function for the SARS-CoV macrodomain that implicates ADP-ribose in the regulation of the innate immune response and helps to demonstrate why this domain is conserved in CoVs. IMPORTANCE The macrodomain is a ubiquitous structural domain that removes ADP-ribose from proteins, reversing the activity of ADP-ribosyltransferases. All coronaviruses contain a macrodomain, suggesting that ADP-ribosylation impacts coronavirus infection. However, its function during infection remains unknown. Here, we found that the macrodomain is an important virulence factor for a highly pathogenic human CoV, SARS-CoV. Viruses with macrodomain mutations that abrogate its ability to remove ADP-ribose from protein were unable to cause lethal disease in mice. Importantly, the SARS-CoV macrodomain suppressed the innate immune response during infection. Our data suggest that an early innate immune response can protect mice from lethal disease. Understanding the mechanism used by this enzyme to promote disease will open up novel avenues for coronavirus therapies and give further insight into the role of macrodomains in viral pathogenesis.

  abstract = {Abstract This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz.

  abstract = {Given the three-dimensional structure of a protein, how can one find the sites where other molecules might bind to it? Do these sites have the properties necessary for high affinity binding? Is this protein a suitable target for drug design? Here, we discuss recent developments in computational methods to address these and related questions. Geometric methods to identify pockets on protein surfaces have been developed over many years but, with new algorithms, their performance is still improving. Simulation methods show promise in accounting for protein conformational variability to identify transient pockets but lack the ease of use of many of the (rigid) shape-based tools. Sequence and structure comparison approaches are benefiting from the constantly increasing size of sequence and structure databases. Energetic methods can aid identification and characterization of binding pockets, and have undergone recent improvements in the treatment of solvation and hydrophobicity. The âdruggabilityâ of a binding site is still difficult to predict with an automated procedure. The methodologies available for this purpose range from simple shape and hydrophobicity scores to computationally demanding free energy simulations. Copyright Â© 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this report we review and structure the branch of molecular visualization that is concerned with the visual analysis of cavities in macromolecular protein structures. First the necessary background, the domain terminology, and the goals of analytical reasoning are introduced. Based on a comprehensive collection of relevant research works, we present a novel classification for cavity detection approaches and structure them into four distinct classes: grid-based, Voronoi-based, surface-based, and probe-based methods. The subclasses are then formed by their combinations. We match these approaches with corresponding visualization technologies starting with direct 3D visualization, followed with non-spatial visualization techniques that for example abstract the interactions between structures into a relational graph, straighten the cavity of interest to see its profile in one view, or aggregate the time sequence into a single contour plot. We also discuss the current state of methods for the visual analysis of cavities in dynamic data such as molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we give an overview of the most common tools that are actively developed and used in the structural biology and biochemistry research. Our report is concluded by an outlook on future challenges in the field.},

  ABSTRACT = {Graph theory (GT) concepts are potentially applicable in the field of computer science (CS) for many purposes. The unique applications of GT in the CS field such as clustering of web documents, cryptography, and analyzing an algorithm&rsquo;s execution, among others, are promising applications. Furthermore, GT concepts can be employed to electronic circuit simplifications and analysis. Recently, graphs have been extensively used in social networks (SNs) for many purposes related to modelling and analysis of the SN structures, SN operation modelling, SN user analysis, and many other related aspects. Considering the widespread applications of GT in SNs, this article comprehensively summarizes GT use in the SNs. The goal of this survey paper is twofold. First, we briefly discuss the potential applications of GT in the CS field along with practical examples. Second, we explain the GT uses in the SNs with sufficient concepts and examples to demonstrate the significance of graphs in SN modeling and analysis.},

  abstract = {Among 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsps), the newly emerging Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes a large, multidomain Nsp3. One of its units is the ADP-ribose phosphatase domain (ADRP; also known as the macrodomain, MacroD), which is believed to interfere with the host immune response. Such a function appears to be linked to the ability of the protein to remove ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated proteins and RNA, yet the precise role and molecular targets of the enzyme remain unknown. Here, five high-resolution (1.07{--}2.01{\AA}) crystal structures corresponding to the apo form of the protein and its complexes with 2-({\it N}-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), AMP and ADP-ribose have been determined. The protein is shown to undergo conformational changes to adapt to the ligand in the manner previously observed in close homologues from other viruses. A conserved water molecule is also identified that may participate in hydrolysis. This work builds foundations for future structure-based research on ADRP, including the search for potential antiviral therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Identification of ligand binding pockets on proteins is crucial for the characterization of protein functions. It provides valuable information for protein-ligand docking and rational engineering of small molecules that regulate protein functions. A major number of current prediction algorithms of ligand binding pockets are based on cubic grid representation of proteins and, thus, the results are often protein orientation dependent.Results: We present the MSPocket program for detecting pockets on the solvent excluded surface of proteins. The core algorithm of the MSPocket approach does not use any cubic grid system to represent proteins and is therefore independent of protein orientations. We demonstrate that MSPocket is able to achieve an accuracy of 75 \% in predicting ligand binding pockets on a test dataset used for evaluating several existing methods. The accuracy is 92\\% if the top three predictions are considered. Comparison to one of the recently published best performing methods shows that MSPocket reaches similar performance with the additional feature of being protein orientation independent. Interestingly, some of the predictions are different, meaning that the two methods can be considered complementary and combined to achieve better prediction accuracy. MSPocket also provides a graphical user interface for interactive investigation of the predicted ligand binding pockets. In addition, we show that overlap criterion is a better strategy for the evaluation of predicted ligand binding pockets than the single point distance criterion.Availability: The MSPocket source code can be downloaded from http://appserver.biotec.tu-dresden.de/MSPocket/. MSPocket is also available as a PyMOL plugin with a graphical user interface.Contact: Â hongboz@biotec.tu-dresden.de; mayte@biotec.tu-dresden.deSupplementary information: Â Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The applicability of this algorithm to the automatic identification of candidate receptor sites in a receptor protein is also discussed using the typical receptor structure dihydrofolate reductase-methotrexate complex.}

  abstract = {Abstract One of the simplest ways to predict ligand binding sites is to identify pocket-shaped regions on the protein surface. Many programs have already been proposed to identify these pocket regions. Examination of their algorithms revealed that a pocket intrinsically has two arbitrary properties, âsizeâ and âdepthâ. We proposed a new definition for pockets using two explicit adjustable parameters that correspond to these two arbitrary properties. A pocket region is defined as a space into which a small probe can enter, but a large probe cannot. The radii of small and large probe spheres are the two parameters that correspond to the âsizeâ and âdepthâ of the pockets, respectively. These values can be adjusted individual putative ligand molecule. To determine the optimal value of the large probe spheres radius, we generated pockets for thousands of protein structures in the database, using several size of large probe spheres, examined the correspondence of these pockets with known binding site positions. A new measure of shallowness, a minimum inaccessible radius, Rinaccess, indicated that binding sites of coenzymes are very deep, while those for adenine/guanine mononucleotide have only medium shallowness and those for short peptides and oligosaccharides are shallow. The optimal radius of large probe spheres was 3â4 Ã for the coenzymes, 4 Ã for adenine/guanine mononucleotides, and 5 Ã or more for peptides/oligosaccharides. Comparison of our program with two other popular pocket-finding programs showed that our program had a higher performance of detecting binding pockets, although it required more computational time.

  abstract = {The number of protein structures is currently increasing at an impressive rate. The growing wealth of data calls for methods to efficiently exploit structural information for medicinal and pharmaceutical purposes. Given the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a validated protein target, the identification of functionally relevant binding sites and the analysis (âmappingâ) of these sites with respect to molecular recognition properties are important initial tasks in structure-based drug design. To address these tasks, a variety of computational tools have been developed. Approaches to identify binding pockets include geometric analyses of protein surfaces, comparisons of protein structures, similarity searches in databases of protein cavities, and docking scans to reveal areas of high ligand complementarity. In the context of binding-site analysis, powerful data mining tools help to retrieve experimental information about related proteinâligand complexes. To identify interaction hot spots, various potential functions and knowledge-based approaches are available for mapping binding regions. The results may subsequently be used to guide virtual screenings for new ligands via pharmacophore searches or docking simulations.}
